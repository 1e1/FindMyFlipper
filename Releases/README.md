# FindMyFlipper Releases

## About

This folder contains compiled firmware files (`faps`) for the FindMyFlipper application. Please note that the current version of these files, named `findmy_NoTagSave_FirmwareName`, has a known bug. 

## Bug Description

The bug in this version prevents the smarttag from being saved upon exiting the app, unless the app is running in the background. As a result, when re-entering the app, the smarttag information needs to be re-entered.

## Fix in Progress

We are actively working on fixing this bug and expect to release an updated version with the fix very soon, possibly later today. 

## Trying Out the Current Version

Despite the bug, we have decided to upload these `fap` files as some users have expressed interest in trying them out. However, we strongly recommend updating to the fixed versions once they are released later today.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.
